    <td scope="row">[[M.V.A.M.]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Temporarily separates the Prometheus-class into three independent ships. Multi Vector Assault Mode divides the Prometheus into three individual combat ships, each equipped with the armament of a small cruiser. After dividing, each 'vector' is designed to coordinate its attack pattern with the other vectors, striking ships with a relentless assault.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Extend Warp Field]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Increases speed of surrounding friendly ships. Expands a low-level warp field around the ship. The speed and maneuverability of all ships inside the field will increase.</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Phaser Overcharge]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires an extremely powerful phaser pulse. An experimental procedure directs the majority of the ship's plasma relays to surge power through the weapons systems, firing an extremely high energy phaser burst at a target through the Prometheus' Alpha Section deflector.</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Assault Run]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Increased speed with a chance to evade incoming fire. The primary computer accelerates the Prometheus to attack speed, while also preparing the maneuvering systems to quickly evade incoming weapons fire.</td>
