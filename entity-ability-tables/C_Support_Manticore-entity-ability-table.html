    <td scope="row">[[Heavy Polaron Beam]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires a beam that does heavy damage and causes further cumulative damage. The crew of this vessel are ordered to immediately fire their experimental Heavy Polaron Beam, dealing massive damage and disrupting the shields of a nearby hostile target. Due to its power draw, firing the heavy beam temporarily disables our other weapons systems.</td>

The Jem'Hadar are instructed to initiate the Delta Assault Pattern, a combat preset that diverts power to propulsion and weapons systems, allowing our loyal soldiers to bring their weapons to bear and blast our enemy to oblivion.</td>
