    <td scope="row">[[Founder Protection]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Permanently summons up to two additional Cychreides dreadnoughts to protect the first. The peerless and faithful crew of the mighty Cychreides Dreadnought are devoted from birth to serve and protect the almighty Founders at all costs. To demonstrate the Dominion's reigning supremacy to the Alpha Quadrant, the ever-wise Founders have willed that we summon additional Cychreides support. Note: 160 supply is required to summon additional dreadnoughts.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Imposing Phantom]]</td>
    <td scope="row">The peerless and faithful crew of the mighty Cychreides Dreadnought know that their vessel is an imposing phantom when seen on the front lines, a mighty warship capable of withstanding heavy punishment and dishing out the same in equal measure. However, there are now defenses available designed to make our dreadnought even more terrifying.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Phased Polaron Lance]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires an immensely powerful beam at an enemy that damages its target and any enemy ships unlucky enough to get in the way. The peerless and faithful crew of the mighty Cychreides Dreadnought have recently installed a powerful Phased Polaron Lance hardpoint on the prow of their vessel, allowing them the capability of launching a cataclysmic first strike against their enemies that will most certainly break their weak morale.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[The Founders Presence]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Provides significant boosts to surrounding allied forces. The peerless and faithful crew of the mighty Cychreides Dreadnought know that when a living god is on-board, that fighting with ever more fervor and prowess makes them proud. When our gods are proud, we are proud. What the Founders say, we shall say. In faith is victory, and victory... is life.</td>
