    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Instantly Traverse via singularity 20,000KM up to 50,000KM around the gravity well while simultaneously granting armour and antimatter absorption. Gul Kentar's obsession with Species 8472 and their Singularity technology has resulted in the development of a new armour material, Kentar's Vessel is the prototype, the material properties enhance defences and draws antimatter from energy attacks after it absorbs fluidic space particles while allowing traversal of fluidic space.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Summon Species 8472]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Opens a rift and summons a fully functional Species 8472 Bioship. Unlike other vessels of its class, Kentars vessel has been able to lure the strongest of all species 8472 bio organisms. Cardassian ships are seen as biotic due to isotonic particles infused into the shields which makes Species 8472 bioships detect them as friendly. The summoned bioships will only attack for short time before their pilots order their vessels to self destruct.</td>
