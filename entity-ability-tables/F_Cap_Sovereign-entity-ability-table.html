    <td scope="row">[[Fire At Will]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Dramatically increases firing rate and coverage at the expense of firepower. Commands the tactical officers to fire all available weapons at will. This increases the quantity and coverage of weapons fire but will reduce the damage per shot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Expert Targeting]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Curtails the enemy's ability to fire back effectively. Expert targeting by the tactical officers on-board Sovereign-class starships prevent enemy vessels from effectively returning fire during engagements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Fleet Coordination]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Boosts the weapons range and accuracy of surrounding allied ships. As the lead ship in most engagements, the Sovereign-class coordinates the actions of the fleet, leading to improved firing ranges and targeting capabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Corbomite Reflector]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Returns a portion of incoming weapons damage to the attacker. Generates a powerful Corbomite Shield, reflecting a portion of hostile weapons fire back toward the attacker's vessel.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[System Integrity]]</td>
    <td scope="row">As Systems are damaged, they will become less effective.</td>
