    <td scope="row">[[Thalaron Wave]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires a powerful thalaron weapon at a planetary target, causing devastating damage to the population. This command initiates an automated countdown for the Cascading Biogenic Pulse, a Thalaron-based phenomenon which destroys all organic life at the subatomic level. In this specific mode, the weapon's radiant intensity is set to encompass a planet-sized target.</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Pattern Shinzon-Theta]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires a barrage that heavily damages an enemy's weapons and shields. This elaborate attack pattern, famously utilized by Praetor Shinzon at the Battle of the Bassen Rift, specifically targets critical weapons systems and shields on enemy warships, rendering them easy prey for the sharp talons of the mighty Scimitar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Perfect Cloak]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Cloaks the Scimitar while still allowing it to fire. This command activates the Scimitar's 'perfect' cloaking device, rendering it completely invisible to all sensor scans, even anti-cloaking scans specifically searching for stray tachyon emissions or residual anti-proton signatures. Additionally, this advanced technology allows the Scimitar to fire while cloaked.</td>
