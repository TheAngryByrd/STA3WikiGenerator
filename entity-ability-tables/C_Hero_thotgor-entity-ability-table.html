    <td scope="row">[[Energy Drain Warhead]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: An advanced version of the energy drain torpedo that disables capital and dreadnought vessels for an extended period and causes heavy damage. The magnanimous Thot Gor orders his vessel to fire a powerful Energy Drain Torpedo, sapping the power of targeted ships, while at the same time disabling their propulsion systems, weapons, and shields, and rendering them defenseless.</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Kidnap and Pillage]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Steals planet production and kidnaps the planets population and reduces allegiance while Thot Gor is raiding with his Breen troops, the long term impact is a reduction of culture output and tax rate as key political figures are kidnapped and logistic centers are damaged and destroyed by the Breen Raids.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Amplification Wave]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Lowers enemy shield restoration by up to 45% and also shield mitigation by up to 5% for 10 targets. The result of Thot Gor's obsessive attempts to recreate the effect of a mysterious cylindrical Probe which passed through Breen space in 2288, this cyclic subspace amplification wave destablizes shield harmonics, heavily reducing mitigation and restore rates.</td>
