    <td scope="row">[[Soliton Feedback Pulse]]</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Proximity Torpedoes      ]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Torpedoes are given an area of effect and longer range, at the expense of the Steamrunner's engine power. A series of high-yield proximity torpedoes are fired from the Steamrunner's weapons pod, causing large area-of-effect damage upon detonation. Note: Steamrunner must be stationary to enable proximity burst mode.</td>
