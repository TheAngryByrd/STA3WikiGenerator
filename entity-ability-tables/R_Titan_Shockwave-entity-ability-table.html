    <td scope="row">EFFECT: The Phoenix self-destructs and unleashes a devastating quantum singularity that destroys or heavily damages everything in the vicinity - be it friend or foe.

    <td scope="row">[[Holographic Fleet]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Generates the image of several cruisers around the Phoenix that draw the enemy's fire. This command activates our vessel's experimental holographic projectors, fabricating a fleet of decoy ships that tricks the enemy into firing at mirages.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Singularity Projector]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Deploys a small black hole that can wreak havoc on enemy formations and cause heavy damage.

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Psionic Blast]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Significantly reduces the target's accuracy. This command activates our vessel's experimental Psionic Field Generator, which bypasses shields and sends the enemy fleet's officers into a paranoid state, affecting their targeting ability.</td>
