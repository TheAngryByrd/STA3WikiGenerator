    <td scope="row">[[Grievous Insult]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Draws fire to the Vor'cha, while boosting hull repair rates. Enemy commanders, boot-licking swine! Shooting slime-ridden space garbage is no test of a warrior's mettle! Bring me an armada worthy of fighting, you pitiful petaQ! Fight me, or face eternal shame for your cowardice! Hab SoSlI' Quch!</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Glorious Charge]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: The Vor'cha's weapon firing rate increases significantly, but at the expense of almost all other systems. Victory or death! Slow to half impulse and divert all power to weapons. These fools cannot contend with the Empire's finest! Gunner, send them to their doom!</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Polaron Torpedo]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires a single specialised torpedo that disables the enemy temporarily. Gunner, prepare to fire a polaron torpedo. Hahaha...when this hits, their ship will keel over like a drunken targ!</td>
