    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Brings in a second Polaris from a parallel universe to temporarily fight by this Polaris' side. Newly approved by Starfleet Command, the Gemini Matrix is a powerful device which summons doppelgangers of the host vessel from a near-identical parallel universe. Once activated, all vessels will be prepared for a temporal assault run.</td>

  <tr>
    <td scope="row">[[Temporal Shockwave]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Freezes time for surrounding enemy ships but disables the weapons on ALL surrounding ships (both friendly and enemy) except for the Polaris herself. A direct result of the many experiments conducted at the Manheim Temporal Research Institute, the Polaris has been equipped with an experimental Manheim Wave Generator designed to suddenly freeze the temporal reference frame in the surrounding gravity well, while still allowing the Polaris the chance to attack.</td>
