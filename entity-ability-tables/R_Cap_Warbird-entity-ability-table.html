    <td scope="row">[[Gravitic Shockwave]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Causes damage over time and decreases enemy accuracy while temporarily leaving the Warbird stationary. This command initiates a perturbation within our vessel's quantum singularity field, generating an expanding gravitic shockwave notably designed to damage the hull integrity and targeting systems of all enemy vessels within its path.</td>

    <td scope="row">[[Cloak Fleet]]</td>
    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Renders all friendly ships in the area temporarily invisible and undetectable. This command orders all Imperial Romulan Warbirds within range to engage their      cloaking devices, hiding themselves from enemy sensors.</td>
