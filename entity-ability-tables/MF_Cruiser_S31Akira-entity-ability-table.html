    <td scope="row">EFFECT: Fires a special torpedo that bounces from target to target, gaining power with each impact. When fired, the CRP draws power from its initial target, then moves to a nearby target, drawing additional energy. The weapon continues to grow in power until it unleashes its entire accumulated force on a single, unfortunate final vessel.</td>
